# Shopping-Platform

A python program written with object - oriented programming in mind, to emulate a local supermarket's billing and purchase system. It is also my first attempt at using object-oriented programming principles to write a program.

Project done as a task for the recruitments into the Coding Club's backend web development division at BITS Pilani - Pilani campus.
